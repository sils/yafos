Yet Another Free Operating System

WHAT IS YAFOS
	YAFOS (Yet Another Free Operating System) is a free open source kernel
	maintained by a large community (currently at maximum two active people ;)).
	The goals at this stage are specificly to build a multitasking OS wich
	supports multiple processor cores and the 64 bit intel architecture.
	(Yeah... hopefully it will. Until then it's just fun to write this ;))
	
	If you need any information, take a look at the doc/ directory or write an
	email to me.

CURRENT STATUS
	TODO?

INSTALL THE TOOLCHAIN
	YAFOS has it's own toolchain to provide independency from gcc updates. (They
	may do harm. TODO make some research on using more of the options given by an
	own compiler.)
	There are currently binaries for Archlinux, 64 bit (host ;)) available in
		tools/cc32/bin/arch64
	Copy these to
		~/yafoscc/i386-yafos-elf/bin/
	(You'll have to create the directory before.)

	If you are using an yet unsupported system you may compile your own
	crosscompiler using
		make cc32
	This will do everything automatically. If it fails, see that all needed
	software is installed (e.g. wget, bison, gperf, gawk) and retry after doing
		rm -R /tmp/ct-ng
	Since there may be temporary files saved.
	The script will create a working directory in your home directory
		~/cc
	If this already exists it will append 'c' until it doesn't. It should remove
	it automatically but that's not guaranteed! Feel free to delete it, it has no
	use after building the toolchain.
	
	Be sure to install qemu before trying to test. Alternatively you can create
	an ISO with grub and the kernel and reboot everytime you want to test. Good
	luck ;)

BUILD
	Be sure to read and follow the instructions given in [INSTALL THE TOOLCHAIN].
	Just execute 'make run' to compile the kernel and start the qemu emulator.
	Qemu may be interfaced with gdb via the command:
		target remote localhost:1234

CONTRIBUTING
	To open all project files we have an editor independend project file. (Yes,
	it's a bash script that just executes your favorite editor with all the files)
	Be sure that your editor supports tabs or so - else you'll get a lot of
	windows. (And who wants windows...)

	Please contact lasse.schuirmann@gmail.com to contribute to this project.
	Be sure to read the programming guidelines, provided in
		doc/programmingGuidelines
	before contributing or even committing any code.
	
	Be aware the the contributed code will be published under the GPL3 License.
