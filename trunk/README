Yet Another Free Operating System

WHAT IS YAFOS
	YAFOS (Yet Another Free Operating System) is a free open source kernel
	maintained by a large community (currently at maximum two active people ;)).
	The goals at this stage are specificly to build a multitasking OS wich
	supports multiple processor cores and the 64 bit intel architecture.
	(Yeah... hopefully it will. Until then it's just fun to write this ;))

CURRENT STATUS
	TODO?

BUILD
	Just execute 'make run' to compile the kernel and start the qemu emulator.
	Qemu may be interfaced with gdb via the command:
		target remote localhost:1234
