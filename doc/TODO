TODOS
- Implement the most used functions in assembly
- extend the makefile so it can automatically create a burnable ISO.

http://wiki.osdev.org/Creating_a_64-bit_kernel
Roadmap for long mode:
	Build x86_64 crosscompiler
	Update the linker file
	Set up Higher half kernel -> research nessecary
	-> use IRETQ for interrupt return
	-> set long-bit in GDT Entries
	-> use ARCH macro in settings.h
		maybe let settings determine automatically wether the compiler compiles
		to 64 bit???

TOOLCHAIN:
	rename it to cc32 and add cc64
	provide support for ubuntu and dependency list for ubuntu.
