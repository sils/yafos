PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

CONTENTS

1. CODE STYLE
2. CONFORMITY
3. INCLUDE GUIDELINES


1. CODE STYLE
	Make sure that over every header file and in all code files without such a
	header file one finds the following header:

/* dir/filename.h
 *
 * Short description. Optional a link to a documentation file in doc/
 *
 * Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>. All Rights Reserved.
 * Written by <name of author> (<mail of author>)
 *
 * This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
 * the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
 * Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
 * version.
 */
	
	(In other languages the first two signs of every line might have to be
	altered.)
	If a code file includes a header file wich belongs to the code
	file (stdint.c -> stdint.h) this header does not have to be placed in the
	code file.


2. CONFORMITY
	Especially when you rewrite standard include files look up if the file you
	want to provide underlies any POSIX standard. One of the goals of this
	project is to be POSIX conform from the beginning on. More information about
	POSIX can be achieved on:
